# Summary
#---------

  This project aims at defining a minimal but powerful script language (G'MIC) dedicated
  to image processing. The interpreter of this language is distributed as an open-source
  module/library embeddable in third-party applications. G'MIC can be used to define
  complex image processing pipelines for converting, manipulating, filtering and visualizing
  generic 1D/2D/3D multi-spectral image datasets. Of course, it is able to manage color images,
  but also more complex data as image sequences or 3D volumetric data.

  G'MIC is an open framework : it is possible to extend the proposed default language with
  custom G'MIC-written commands, defining thus new image filters. By the way, it already
  contains a substantial set of pre-defined image processing algorithms.

  In this package, you will find the sources of the G'MIC interpreter and two binary tools :

    * A binary executable gmic for using the G'MIC interpreter from the command line.
    * An interactive plug-in gmic_gimp for extending the capabilities of the image retouching
      software GIMP.

  G'MIC has been designed with portability in mind and runs on different platforms.
  It can be easily re-used in any other free software, as an external library.
  It is developed in the Image Team of the GREYC laboratory, in Caen/France, by permanent
  researchers working in the image processing field.

 The source code of G'MIC and the G'MIC Toolbox for Gimp is distributed under
 the CECILL v.2.0 license (file 'Licence_CeCILL_V2-en.txt').
 This License is a Free-Software license, compatible with the GPL license
 (using those files in a distributed closed-source project is then forbidden).

 The CeCiLL v.2.0 license ( http://www.cecill.info/index.en.html ) have been
 created under the supervision of the three biggest research institutions on
 computer sciences in France :

# How to build G'MIC ?
#---------------------

 To build the full G'MIC version (including command line and plug-in versions), just
 type 'configure' in the main G'MIC directory. Then, go for a coffee, because the compilation
 time for the command line version is quite long. If you are interested by the G'MIC plug-in
 only, go to the 'src/' directory, and type 'make gimp'. You need the gimptools as well
 as the libfftw3 developpement files installed on your system to be able to compile G'MIC.

# How to install the G'MIC plug-in for GIMP ?
#---------------------------------------------

 Once you have your 'gmic_gimp' file available for your system, just copy it in your
 GIMP plug-in directory. On Unix, this is usually in '$HOME/.gimp-2.x/plug-ins/'.
 On Windows, this is usually in 'C:\Program Files\GIMP-2.x\lib\gimp\2.0\plugins\'.
 Run GIMP, and the 'G'MIC...' entry should appear at the end of your 'Filters' menu.
