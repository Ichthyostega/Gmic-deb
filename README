# Summary
#---------

 G'MIC stands for 'GREYC's Magic Image Converter'. This project aims to :

 * Define a lightweight but powerful script language (G'MIC) dedicated to the
   design of image processing pipelines.
 * Provide an interpreter of this language, distributed as a C++
   open-source library embeddable in third-party applications.
 * Propose three usable binary tools embedding this interpreter :

   - The command-line executable 'gmic' to use the G'MIC framework from a
     shell. 
   - The interactive and extensible plug-in 'gmic_gimp' to bring G'MIC capabilities
     to the image retouching software GIMP.
   - ZArt, a real-time interface for webcam images manipulation.

 G'MIC is focused on the design of possibly complex pipelines for converting,
 manipulating, filtering and visualizing generic 1d/2d/3d multi-spectral image
 datasets. This includes of course color images, but also more complex data
 as image sequences or 3d(+t) volumetric float-valued datasets.

 G'MIC is an open framework : the default language can be extended with
 custom G'MIC-written commands, defining thus new image available filters or
 effects. By the way, it already contains a substantial set of pre-defined image
 processing algorithms and pipelines (more than 1000).

 G'MIC has been designed with portability in mind and runs on different
 platforms (Windows, Unix, MacOSX). It is distributed under the CeCILL license
 (GPL-compatible). Since 2008, it is developed in the Image Team of the GREYC
 laboratory, in Caen/France, by permanent researchers working in the field of
 image processing on a daily basis.

# Licenses
#----------

 The C++ source code of G'MIC is distributed under
 the CECILL v.2.0 license (file 'CeCILL.rtf').
 This License is a Free-Software license, compatible with the GPL
 (using those files in a distributed closed-source project is then forbidden).

 The CeCiLL v.2.0 license ( http://www.cecill.info/index.en.html ) have been
 created under the supervision of the three biggest research institutions on
 computer sciences in France :

   - CNRS  ( http://www.cnrs.fr/ )
   - CEA   ( http://www.cea.fr/ )
   - INRIA ( http://www.inria.fr/ )

# How to install the GIMP plug-in
#---------------------------------

  GIMP (http://www.gimp.org) is an open-source painting and image retouching
  software which can be extended with additional 'plug-ins'.
  G'MIC provides such a plug-in, named 'gmic_gimp'. To install the G'MIC
  plug-in for GIMP, you have to copy the file 'gmic_gimp' (Unix) or
  'gmic_gimp.exe' (Windows) to the plug-in folder of your GIMP installation.

  This folder is usually located at :

  - on Unix : '$HOME/.gimp-2.x/plug-ins/' (for local installation),
              or 'usr/lib/gimp/2.0/plug-ins/' (for global installation).

  - on Windows : 'C:\Program Files\GIMP-2.x\lib\gimp\2.0\plugins\'
                 (for global installation).

  - on MacOSX : '$HOME/Library/Application\ Support/Gimp/plug-ins/'
                (for installation from GimponOSX).
