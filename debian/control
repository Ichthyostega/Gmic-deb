Description: GREYC's Magic Image Converter
 G'MIC is an interpreter of image processing macros whose goal is to
 convert, manipulate and visualize generic 1D/2D/3D multi-spectral
 image files. This includes classical color images, but also more
 complex data as image sequences or 3D volumetric images.
 .
 This package contains the stand-alone gmic binary and ZArt, a
 program whose purpose is to demonstrate the possibilities of
 the G'MIC image processing language by offering the choice of several
 manipulations on a video stream acquired from a webcam. In other words,
 ZArt is a GUI for G'MIC real-time manipulations on the output of a webcam.
