gmic (2.4.1-3) unstable; urgency=medium

  [ Pino Toscano ]
  * [684a080] Change builddir of gmic-qt to build-gmic-qt.
    Change the build directory of gmic-qt from a subdirectory of the sources
    to a top-level directory; this will help debhelper in cleaning the build
    directory, as it can just wipe it.
  * [b3bdb48] Use debhelper to build & clean everything.
    Pass the proper combinations of source & build directories: this has few
    advantages:
    - all the proper flags for cmake/qmake are passed, no need to manually
      take care of them
    - CFLAGS/CXXFLAGS/etc are handled too
    - the parallel option of debhelper is respected too
    Also switch to dh_auto_clean for proper clean handling.
  * [c6868df] Move common gmic-qt build flags to a variable
  * [03f988c] Disable static build of libgmic.
    It is not installed, so do not waste time building it.
  * [31a1738] Change build directory to build-gmic.
    Use a fixed name for it, so it will be possible in the future to use
    artifacts in it in a simpler way.
  * [3c0b61d] Link all binaries dynamically.
    Switch the build of all the binaries to dynamically link to libgmic,
    instead of building their own copies of gmic; this drastically reduces
    the build time, and avoids different build configurations for the gmic
    build copies in the binaries.
    Add a patch for zart so it is possible to specify the right path to the
    build gmic libraries.
    As result, tighten the libgmic1 dependencies everywhere.
  * [536b4d6] Explicitly pass GMIC_PATH for zart
  * [770685e] Link in as-needed mode.
    Reduce the overlinking, especially now that all the binaries use the
    shared gmic library.

  [ Pino Toscano ]
  * [d9a8811] Bump cmake build dependency to 3.12.
    This is what the upstream build system requires, and this version is
    not in stable.
  * [11cb24b] Simplify install files.
    Do not specify the destination in case it is the same as the source.
  * [700f77e] Stop using dh-exec.
    There is no more need for environment variables in install files, so
    stop using dh-exec for some of the install files.
  * [d2e2a0e] Install the cmake config files of libgmic
  * [2eae082] Remove ${shlibs:Depends} from libgmic-dev.
    There are no binaries in libgmic-dev.
